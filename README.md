# ReviewBoard Navigation Links

UserScript which adds "To Me" and "Outgoing" links to the navigation bar of the
Apache Review Board instance.

While these links exist on the left on the dashboard, I found myself frequently
navigating from a review back to "to me" and my own "outgoing" reviews, and
preferred links be in the top navigation bar, instead of just the dashboard or
my own bookmarks.

This script can be installed via
[Greasy Fork](https://greasyfork.org/en/scripts/34694-reviewboard-navigation-links).
